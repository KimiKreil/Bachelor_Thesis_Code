\section{Discussion}
\begin{itemize}
    \item What are pros and cons of the Farmer method? Is the Farmer residual image better than Iary's old one?
    \item Is ML really better than visual classification? pros and cons of t-SNE.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item They work together since we do need some tracers to be able to classify anything.
        \item PRO: ML is significantly faster. Reduces the sample to look at.
        \item CON: not a direct pipeline, the t-SNE embedding has to be reconfigured everytime we add new data. Does run quite fast so not an imediate problem.
        \item PRO: We used t-SNE on not the most optimal data. Perhaps it will perform better with a better and more robust residual map than can be developed from the farmer catalogue.
        \item PRO: if we design the labeling of tracers for this purpose, i.e. also labeling bad candidates it might perform a little better. (not sure about this one but worth looking into)
        \item PRO: we can chose the sensitivity. Do we want a larger sample with more contamination or a pure smaller sample. Easy to make that choice in ML, just changing fmin, and we can chose which result we want to use depending on the application.
    \end{itemize}
    \item How the COSMOS dropout galaxies look like? (eg colors, etc) Do they "agree" with previously discovered droupouts? Compare to results from \cite{Wang_2019} and \cite{Alcalde_Pampliega_2019}
    \item A very quick discussion/speculation about how these objects fit into the "big picture" of galaxy evolution.
\end{itemize}
