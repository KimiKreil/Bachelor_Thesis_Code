\section{Discussion}

- What are pros and cons of the Farmer method? Is the Farmer residual image better than Iary's old one?

- Is ML really better than visual classification? pros and cons of t-SNE.

- How the COSMOS dropout galaxies look like? (eg colors, etc) 
Do they ``agree'' with previously discovered droupouts?

- A very quick discussion/speculation about how these objects fit into the "big picture" of galaxy evolution.
