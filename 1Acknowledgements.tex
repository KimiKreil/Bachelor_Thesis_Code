First and foremost, I wish to express my sincere gratitude to my main supervisors Iary Davidzon and Franscesco M. Valentino for their engagement and exceptional guidance during this project. I would like to give Iary a special thanks for his creativity and his patience with me during this project, and Fransesco, I thank, for his keen eye to detail. Finally, I would also like to thank Linea Hedemark for her great spirits and support during the COVID-19 lockdown where our thesis workdays proved invaluable for my productivity.
