\section{Introduction}
\begin{itemize}
    \item General properties of dusty galaxies and galaxy evolution - why is this interesting?
    \item Distant galaxies are studied through photometric analysis. A large catalogue theory is based on is the COSMOS 2015 (CLASSIC) catalogue.
    \item Problems with this catalogue and this method of studying galaxies. Recent work revealed "hidden galaxies" \cite{Wang_2019} and \cite{Alcalde_Pampliega_2019}. Also new catalogue FARMER that can be used for this.
    \item Suggests that a type of galaxies have been systematically overlooked due to their faintness. This project suggest a method automising the way we can identify these.
    \item Quick overview of how we will do it. Describe which sections to find it.
    \item What can we expect - anticipations
\end{itemize}
